# Beginner's Guide

Welcome to the Prisma Beginner's Guide -- a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough that takes you from zero to a fully working encrypted proxy setup. No prior experience with networking, servers, or the command line is required.

## What you will learn

By the end of this guide you will understand how internet privacy works, how Prisma protects your traffic, and how to deploy and operate your own Prisma infrastructure.

**Total estimated time: ~2.5 hours** (you can split it across multiple sessions).

## Prerequisites

You only need two things to get started:

1. **A computer or phone** -- Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, or iOS
2. **An internet connection**

That is it. Everything else -- servers, certificates, credentials -- is explained as we go.

:::tip No experience needed
This guide assumes **zero** prior knowledge about networking, servers, or the command line. Every concept is explained from the ground up with analogies and diagrams. If something is unclear, it is our fault, not yours.

## How to use this guide

- **Read in order** -- each chapter builds on the previous one
- **Do not skip the basics** -- even if you are tempted, the [basics chapter](./basics.md) will help you understand everything that follows
- **Try things out** -- the best way to learn is by doing; follow along with the examples
- **Do not worry about mistakes** -- nothing in this guide can break your computer; if something goes wrong, you can always start over

## Prisma at a glance

Prisma (v2.32.0) is a next-generation encrypted proxy built in Rust. It creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and a server you control, making your internet traffic private and resistant to detection.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Your Device
        B["Browser / Apps"]
        PC["Prisma Client"]
    end
    subgraph Internet
        FW["Firewalls & DPI"]
    end
    subgraph Your Server
        PS["Prisma Server"]
    end
    subgraph Destination
        W["Websites & Services"]
    end

```

Key capabilities:

- **8 transport types** -- QUIC, TCP, WebSocket, gRPC, XHTTP, XPorta, SSH, WireGuard
- **PrismaVeil v5 protocol** -- 1-RTT handshake, 0-RTT resumption, ChaCha20-Poly1305 / AES-256-GCM, 1024-bit anti-replay
- **Anti-detection** -- padding, timing jitter, chaff injection, entropy camouflage, active probe resistance
- **Cross-platform** -- Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, FreeBSD
- **Post-quantum ready** -- hybrid key exchange for forward security
