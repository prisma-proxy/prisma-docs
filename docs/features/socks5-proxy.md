# SOCKS5 Proxy

Prisma implements a full RFC 1928 SOCKS5 proxy interface on the client side (v1.5.0). Applications connect to the local SOCKS5 port, and traffic is transparently tunneled through the encrypted PrismaVeil connection to the server.

## Supported features

- **IPv4** address connections
- **IPv6** address connections
- **Domain name** resolution (resolved at the server side)
- **CONNECT** command (TCP proxying)
- **UDP ASSOCIATE** command (UDP proxying via [PrismaUDP](/docs/features/prismaudp)) — supports games, VoIP, and DNS relay
- No authentication required on the local SOCKS5 interface (secured by local binding)

## Configuration

The SOCKS5 listener is always enabled. Configure the bind address in `client.toml`:

```toml
socks5_listen_addr = "127.0.0.1:1080"
```

By default, it binds to `127.0.0.1:1080`.

## Data flow

```
Application ──SOCKS5──▶ prisma-client ──PrismaVeil/QUIC──▶ prisma-server ──TCP──▶ Destination
```

1. The application sends a SOCKS5 CONNECT request with the destination address and port
2. The client parses the SOCKS5 request and extracts the destination (IPv4, IPv6, or domain)
3. The client sends a `CONNECT` command through the encrypted PrismaVeil tunnel
4. The server resolves the destination (if domain) and opens a TCP connection
5. Data is relayed bidirectionally through the encrypted tunnel

## Usage with curl

```bash
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:1080 https://httpbin.org/ip
curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:1080 https://example.com
```

The `--socks5-hostname` variant sends the domain name to the server for resolution, avoiding local DNS leaks.

## Usage with browsers

### Firefox

1. Open Settings > Network Settings > Manual proxy configuration
2. Set SOCKS Host to `127.0.0.1`, Port to `1080`
3. Select **SOCKS v5**
4. Check **Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5** to prevent DNS leaks

### Chrome / Chromium

Launch with the proxy flag:

```bash
chromium --proxy-server="socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"
```

## Usage with system-wide proxy

On Linux, many applications respect the `ALL_PROXY` environment variable:

```bash
export ALL_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
```
